Purchase via Ethereum

Attempt to use the Knowledge from the Courses Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 101 / 201.

I have used html, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MetaMask Legacy Web3 Extension.
To get MetaMask to work I've hosted the files locally with the console commands:
 -npm install http-server -g
 -http-server

My goal was to offer the Service "Call with a Community Member" via Ethereum Payment to the client.
I wanted the payment to be handled conveniently with MetaMask.
When clicking on the "order personal call" button the client is redirected to a new page where he can choose which person to call and for what amount of time.
When clicking on "purchase" MetaMask legacy opens up and the transaction can be handled through MetaMask
